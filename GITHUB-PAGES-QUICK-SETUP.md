## Troubleshooting

**If you don't see "Pages" in the sidebar:**
- Make sure you're on the repository page (not your account page)
- The URL should be: `github.com/kowalcg/ChocolateOnJames`
- You need to be the repository owner or have admin access

**If "Pages" is grayed out:**
- The repository might be private (free accounts can't use Pages on private repos)
- Or there might be a temporary GitHub issue
