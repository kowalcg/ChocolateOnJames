Hi Dale,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly, and I completely understand about waiting until you're back from Alberta. Family time is important.

**Friday, November 28 works perfectly for me.** I'd be happy to schedule our meeting for that morning, anytime after 9:30 AM as you prefer. Let me know what specific time works best for you both.

In the meantime, I've put together everything we've created into a comprehensive, easy-to-access dashboard. I wanted to share this with you now so you can review it before our meeting:

**👉 [https://kowalcg.github.io/ChocolateOnJames/](https://kowalcg.github.io/ChocolateOnJames/)**

This dashboard gives you instant access to all our Phase 1 deliverables. Here's what you'll find:

- **70+ documents** with **600+ pages** of research, analysis, and strategic recommendations
- **Interactive dashboard** organized into 18 deliverable areas for easy navigation
- **Complete research and analysis** across all strategic areas
- **Comprehensive prompt generator tool** for social media image generation (pre-loaded with Chocolat on James brand voice)
- All documents available in both **PDF and Markdown formats**
- **50+ Canva templates**, email templates, blog templates, and more
- Everything accessible from any browser - no downloads required to view

The dashboard is organized across tabs like Executive Summary, All Deliverables, Key Findings, Growth Projections, Recommendations, Tools & Resources, and E-commerce Ecosystem so you can easily jump to the section you need. During our meeting on Friday, I'll walk you through everything and answer any questions you have.

**If Friday doesn't end up working** or if you'd prefer to meet sooner, I'm flexible and happy to work around your schedule. I know you mentioned tomorrow (Friday morning at 9 AM) as an option - I can make that work if needed, though I think having a bit more time to review the materials might be helpful.

**Also, I'll be attending the Small Business Forum in Hamilton on James Street this Tuesday, November 25.** If it works out, I'd love to drop by the shop to say hello while I'm in the area!

Looking forward to our call on Friday and to hearing your thoughts on the deliverables.

Best regards,  
Greg

**P.S.** When you get a chance this afternoon, I'd appreciate an update on the Pavement website status. It will help me align the implementation timeline accordingly.
