## Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Wrong

**Risk 1: You're Too Busy** (HIGH probability)
- Already working 84 hours/week
- Mitigation: Hire production assistant Month 3-4 ($6K), frees 20 hours/week
- Or: Choose Hybrid package with marketing coordinator

**Risk 2: Learning Curve Too Steep** (MEDIUM probability)
- AI tools unfamiliar
- Mitigation: I provide training and templates; most clients proficient in 2 weeks
- Fallback: Can upgrade to Hybrid mid-stream

**Risk 3: Lower Than Expected Results** (MEDIUM probability)
- Online sales slow to ramp
- Mitigation: Conservative projections; focus on high-ROI channels first (email, local SEO)
- Lower investment means lower revenue needed for positive ROI

**Risk 4: Cash Flow Strain** (LOW probability)
- $28K is manageable from operations
- Mitigation: Phase spending; optional $5K line of credit as buffer

### What Won't Go Wrong

✅ The strategy is proven (competitors doing this successfully)  
✅ The tools work (AI is reliable, millions using)  
✅ The market exists ($15-20M serviceable market in Hamilton)  
✅ Your product is good (established business, returning customers)  
✅ The investment is low ($28K vs. $125K)
