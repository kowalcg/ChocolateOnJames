## 📞 Client Pitch Summary

### The Elevator Pitch for Dan

*"Dan, I analyzed your business and here's the reality: You're at $537K with zero marketing and no e-commerce. That's actually good news—it means huge upside with basic business fundamentals.*

*Most consultants would tell you to spend $125K on agencies. I'm not most consultants.*

*I've built two e-commerce businesses to multi-million dollars. I used to spend $100K+ on agencies. Now I use AI tools and automation—same results, $2K in costs instead of $100K.*

*I can teach you this approach. For $28K total ($11,500 is my consulting fee), we'll:*
- *Launch your e-commerce platform*
- *Implement AI-powered marketing*
- *Build your customer database*
- *Start corporate gifting program*

*You'll do the work (30 hours/week), but with my guidance and AI tools. By Month 12: $650-675K revenue, you'll have digital marketing skills, and your business will be worth $1.5M+.*

*Year 2: $900K. Year 3: $1.2M. All while reducing your hours from 84/week to 50-60.*

*The $28K pays for itself in 4-5 months. Then it's pure profit.*

*I've done this twice. Let me show you how."*
