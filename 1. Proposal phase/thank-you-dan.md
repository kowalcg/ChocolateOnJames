Hi Dan,

Thank you so much for your decision to move forward with the project! I'm genuinely excited about this partnership and the incredible potential we're going to unlock for Chocolat on James.

I'm currently wrapping up at the Toronto Waterfront Expo, but I wanted to send a quick note to acknowledge your decision and let you know what's next.

## 📅 **NEXT STEPS:**

I'll send you a detailed email on **Monday morning** with:
- Store visit scheduling options (Monday/Tuesday next week)
- Complete project kickoff details
- Phase 1 timeline and deliverables confirmation
- Contract and payment setup information

## 🎯 **WHAT TO EXPECT:**

The store visit will be a comprehensive 2-3 hour session where we'll assess your current operations, review your product catalog, and kick off Phase 1 of the project. This will set us up perfectly for the 4-6 week foundation and strategy phase.

## ⏰ **TIMELINE:**

- **Monday:** Detailed email with scheduling and next steps
- **Monday/Tuesday:** Store visit and project kickoff
- **Wednesday, October 22:** Phase 1 official start
- **End of November:** Phase 1 completion with corporate gifting materials ready for December

I'm confident this is going to be a game-changer for Chocolat on James. The $140-200K revenue opportunity we identified is very real, and I'm excited to help you capture it.

Thank you for trusting me with this project. Talk to you Monday!

Best regards,
