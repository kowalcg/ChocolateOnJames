- **Total Variable**: ~32.5-42.5% of revenue

### Break-Even Calculation

**Formula**: Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin %

**Contribution Margin**: 
- Revenue (100%) - Variable Costs (32.5-42.5%) = 57.5-67.5%

**Break-Even Revenue**:
- Conservative (67.5% CM): $157,000 ÷ 0.675 = $232,593
- Moderate (62.5% CM): $176,000 ÷ 0.625 = $281,600
- Liberal (57.5% CM): $195,000 ÷ 0.575 = $339,130

**Current Revenue**: $537,000

**Safety Margin**: $197-305K above break-even (37-57% cushion)

**Assessment**: Business has healthy safety margin above break-even, providing capacity to invest in growth.

## Cash Flow Considerations

### Working Capital Requirements

**Current State**:
- Inventory: ~$15-25K (estimated)
- Accounts Receivable: ~$5-10K (if any corporate clients)
- Cash buffer: Unknown

**Growth State - Working Capital Needs**:
- Increased inventory for online: +$10-15K
- E-commerce platform costs: +$10K (one-time)
- Marketing prepayments: +$5-10K
- **Additional Working Capital Needed**: $25-35K

**Cash Flow Timing**:
- E-commerce setup: Front-loaded (Months 1-2)
- Marketing spend: Monthly ongoing
- E-commerce revenue: Gradual build (Months 3-12)
- Corporate revenue: Concentrated Q4

**Cash Flow Risk**: Investment required before revenue materializes

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Phase investments (start with email, then e-commerce, then ads)
2. Focus on quick-win revenue (email to existing customers)
3. Negotiate payment terms with suppliers
4. Consider small business line of credit ($25K) for cash flow smoothing
5. Manage inventory carefully during transition

### Seasonal Cash Flow Management

**Challenge**: December generates 16.6% of annual revenue, January only 3.2%

**Current Impact**:
- Large December cash influx
- January cash crunch
- Difficulty maintaining staff through low season

**Strategies**:
1. **Cash Reserves**: Hold 2-3 months of operating expenses in reserve
2. **Seasonal Staffing**: More part-time staff to flex with demand
3. **Prepaid Products**: Sell gift cards and subscriptions (advance cash)
4. **Corporate Timing**: Secure corporate commitments (deposits) in Q3 for Q4 delivery
5. **Smooth Marketing**: Invest marketing in slow months to boost revenue
