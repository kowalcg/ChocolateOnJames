## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Market Risks

- Mitigation: Move fast on e-commerce; own local positioning; build customer relationships
- Probability: Medium (30-40%)

- Mitigation: Expand to GTA via e-commerce; develop new customer segments (corporate, events)
- Probability: Low (10-15%)

### Operational Risks

- Impact: Dan's bandwidth limits execution of growth plans
- Mitigation: Hire key staff (production manager, marketing coordinator); automate processes; prioritize initiatives
- Probability: High (60-70%)

**Risk 5: Quality Control**
- Impact: Rapid growth compromises product quality
- Mitigation: Document recipes/processes; train staff thoroughly; maintain standards; scale deliberately
- Probability: Medium (25-35%)

**Risk 6: Cash Flow Crunch**

- Mitigation: Phase investments; establish line of credit; manage inventory carefully; monitor cash weekly
- Probability: Medium (30-40%)

### Financial Risks

**Risk 7: Marketing ROI Underperformance**
- Impact: Marketing spend doesn't generate expected revenue
- Mitigation: Start small, test, optimize before scaling; track ROI rigorously; cut underperforming channels quickly

**Risk 8: E-commerce Slower Than Expected**
- Impact: Online sales below projections
- Mitigation: Invest in professional photography; optimize checkout; offer promotions; focus on email marketing
- Probability: Medium (30-40%)

### Mitigation Strategy Summary

1. **Start Small, Scale Fast**: Test channels before major investment
