## What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Common Mistakes

❌ **Under-invest in Marketing**: $0 → $20K won't work. Need $65-85K for growth  
❌ **Skip Photography**: Poor photos kill online conversion - invest in professional  
❌ **Ignore Data**: Track metrics religiously - what gets measured gets managed  
❌ **Try Everything**: Focus on top priorities - saying yes to everything = no to success  
❌ **Discount Heavily**: Not a discount brand - maintain premium positioning and pricing  
❌ **Neglect Existing Customers**: Email list is gold - nurture it  
❌ **Over-complicate**: Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary  
❌ **Assume and Hope**: Test, measure, validate - hope is not a strategy  
❌ **Burn Out**: Dan's health and energy are business assets - protect them
