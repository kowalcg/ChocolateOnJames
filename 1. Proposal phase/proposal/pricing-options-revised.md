- Hire part-time help for production (free Dan's time)
- Use AI extensively (80% of content creation)
- Monthly check-ins adjust timeline if needed
- Your support for troubleshooting

### Risk 2: Technical Learning Curve

**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium  

**Mitigation**:
- Step-by-step video tutorials (Loom)

### Risk 4: Slower Revenue Ramp

**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Low
