## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Strategy ($4,500)**
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks (Oct-Dec 2025)
**Perfect Timing:** During your busy holiday season

**What You Get:**
1. **Complete Business Analysis** - Competitive research, financial analysis, market opportunities
2. **12-Month Growth Roadmap** - Quarterly milestones and revenue targets
3. **Corporate Gifting Program** - Templates, pricing, outreach process for immediate revenue
4. **Quick Wins Implementation** - Email capture, Google Business Profile optimization
5. **E-Commerce Planning** - Platform selection, product strategy, launch timeline

**Why Phase 1 First:**
- ✅ Get complete strategy before committing to larger investment
- ✅ Implement corporate quick wins during December (immediate revenue)
- ✅ Prove value before Phase 2 decision
- ✅ Perfect timing (you're busy with holidays, we do research)

### **Phase 2: E-Commerce Implementation (TBD)**
**Timing:** January-March 2026 (after your holiday rush)
**Investment:** Quoted after Phase 1 based on final requirements
**Approach:** Greg provides architecture/consulting, external developer handles implementation

## INVESTMENT & ROI

### **Phase 1 Investment: $4,500**
- 50% upfront: $2,250
- 30% at midpoint: $1,350  
- 20% on delivery: $900

- **Email marketing setup:** $20-30K Year 1
- **Complete strategy:** Foundation for $140-205K total growth

## WHY THIS WORKS

**Perfect Timing:**
- Phase 1 during your busy season (we do research while you run business)
- Phase 2 during slow season (perfect for learning new systems)

**Risk-Free Approach:**
- Start with $4,500 Phase 1 (prove value first)
- Phase 2 decision after seeing results
- No pressure to commit to everything upfront

**I know you're only 2 weeks into ownership, so this might feel like a lot. That's exactly WHY I structured this as Phase 1 first ($4,500). You get the complete roadmap, implement some quick wins in December, THEN decide on Phase 2. No pressure, no risk.**

**Proven Results:**
- Similar businesses see 20-30% revenue growth in Year 1
- E-commerce typically generates 15-20% of total revenue
- Corporate gifting provides steady, high-margin revenue
