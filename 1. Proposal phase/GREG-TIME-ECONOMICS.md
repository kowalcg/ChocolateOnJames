## Revised Scope - Reduce Your Workload

### Phase 1 - Streamlined Deliverables

**Remove or Simplify:**
- ❌ **Product Profitability Analysis** - Requires too much data from Dan, time-intensive
- ❌ **Partnership Map** with outreach - Just provide list and templates, don't do outreach
- ✂️ **Financial Tracking Setup** - Reduce to: QBO setup guide (1 hour vs. 2)

**Keep Core Value Items:**
- ✅ Competitive Analysis (high value, mostly automated)
- ✅ Website Audit (high value, mostly automated)
- ✅ Financial Analysis (critical for projections)
- ✅ Market Research (justifies strategy)
- ✅ 12-Month Roadmap (THE key deliverable)
- ✅ Marketing Strategy (reusable templates)
- ✅ Corporate Gifting Program (quick win revenue generator)
- ✅ 2 Follow-up Calls (relationship building)

**Updated Phase 1 Time** (with SEO/content added): **32-35 hours**  
**Effective Rate:** $4,500 / 32-35 hours = **$129-141/hour**

**Breakdown:**
- Competitive + website audit: 6 hours (automated)
- Financial + market research: 8 hours (AI-assisted)
- Roadmap + strategy: 10 hours (templates + Claude)
- SEO + keyword research: 3 hours (DataForSEO MCP + Claude)
- Content plan + social strategy: 7 hours (Claude generates, Greg refines)
- Corporate materials: 4 hours (Canva + Claude)
- Calls + coordination: 5 hours

**Assessment:** With SEO/content added, rate drops slightly but deliverable is MORE complete and valuable. Still acceptable at $129-141/hour for strategy work.

- 12-month roadmap (THE deliverable)
- Corporate gifting program (his quick win)

**Pitch:** "Once we complete Phase 2 and your e-commerce is live, many clients opt for ongoing monthly support. We'll revisit in March based on your needs and results."

### 4. Use This Project as Template

**Build Once, Sell Many:**
- Research and templates are 80% reusable for next chocolate client
- Corporate gifting program transferable
- Marketing strategy frameworks same for all food retail
- Next chocolate client: 20 hours vs. 30 hours (40% faster)
- **Effective rate improves** with each similar project

- Clients 2-5: 18-20 hours Phase 1 (60% faster)
- Same $4,500 fee
- Effective rate: $225-250/hour

## Bottom Line for Greg

**Should you take this project?**

**If you can:**
