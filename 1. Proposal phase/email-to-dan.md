**Subject:** Chocolat on James - $140-200K Growth Opportunity (2 docs)

---

Hi Dan,

Hope your first two weeks as owner have been exciting!

Based on our conversation, I've identified $140-200K in untapped revenue opportunities for Chocolat on James. The analysis shows clear paths through e-commerce, corporate gifting, and digital marketing.

## 📄 TWO DOCUMENTS ATTACHED:

1. **Executive Summary (2 pages)** ← START HERE
   • Key opportunities and quick wins
   • Investment breakdown and ROI
   • Next steps and timeline

2. **Full Business Proposal (42 pages)** ← Deep dive if interested
   • Complete competitive analysis
   • Detailed financial projections
   • Implementation roadmaps

## ⏱️ READING TIME:
- Executive Summary: 5-10 minutes (coffee break)
- Full Proposal: 30-45 minutes (when you have time)

## 🎯 THE APPROACH:

**Phase 1 ($4,500): Foundation & Strategy** (Oct-Dec)
- Complete roadmap + corporate program
- Quick wins in December (immediate revenue)
- You decide on Phase 2 after seeing results

**Phase 2 ($9-15K based on similar projects): E-Commerce Launch** (Jan-Mar)
- Quoted after Phase 1 based on requirements
- Perfect timing (your slow season, post-holidays)

I know you're only 2 weeks into ownership, so this might feel like a lot. That's exactly WHY I structured Phase 1 separately. You get the roadmap now, implement quick wins in December, then decide on Phase 2 in January. No pressure.

## 📅 TIMELINE:
Decision needed by **Friday, October 17** to start Phase 1 on October 20 and deliver before your December rush.
