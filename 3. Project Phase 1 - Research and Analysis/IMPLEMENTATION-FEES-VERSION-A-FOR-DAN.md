## Time-Sensitive Decision: Corporate Gifting

**⏰ URGENT: Decision needed by November 25**

**Why urgent?**
- December is THE month for corporate holiday gifting
- Companies book in early December for year-end gifts
- Miss this window = miss $15-25K revenue opportunity
- Can't make this up later in the year

**If you want Corporate Gifting Blitz ($2,200):**
- Need to start by December 1
- Gives us 3-4 weeks to execute before holidays
- Can still capture significant Q4 corporate revenue

**Other projects can start January 2026**

## Your Questions Answered

**Q: Why is this more than the original Phase 2 estimate?**
A: Original estimate was for Shopify build ($9K-15K). Since Pavement is handling that, pricing shifted to marketing implementation at fair market rates while still being 50-70% below agency pricing.

**Q: Can I negotiate?**
A: This is relationship pricing for existing clients. I've already factored in our Phase 1 work together. For new clients, I charge 15-25% more. But I'm open to discussing payment plans or phasing if budget is tight.

**Q: What if I want to do some things myself?**
A: Perfect! That's why project-based exists. Pick the projects you need help with (email, Google Ads, corporate), DIY the rest with hourly consulting as needed.

**Q: What if I'm not sure about ongoing retainer?**
A: Start with just the projects ($8,700). See results. Then decide on retainer later. No commitment required.

**Q: Will you work with the Pavement team?**
A: Absolutely. I'll coordinate directly with them to optimize your platform while I handle marketing implementation.
