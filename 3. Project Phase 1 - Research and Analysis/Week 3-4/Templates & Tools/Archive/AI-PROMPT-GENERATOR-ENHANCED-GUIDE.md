## Logo & Branding Instructions

### The Challenge
AI image generators can't upload your logo directly, so we provide instructions instead.

### The Solution
When you enable "Include Logo Placement":

**The prompt will:**
- Reserve space for logo (bottom right corner)
- Specify optimal size (120x120px area)
- Ensure good contrast for logo visibility

**After generating the image:**
1. Download the AI-generated image
2. Open in Canva, Photoshop, or any image editor
3. Add your Chocolat on James logo to bottom right
4. Use white logo on dark backgrounds
5. Use dark logo on light backgrounds
6. Add subtle drop shadow for visibility

**Pro Tips:**
- Keep logo at 10-15% of image size
- Maintain consistent placement across all images
- Use PNG logo with transparent background
- Add white outline if logo blends into background

- The custom text field appears below the dropdown

### "Regenerate button doesn't work"
- You must generate a prompt first
- Regenerate only works after initial generation

### "Logo instructions are confusing"
- Remember: AI generates the image WITHOUT logo
- YOU add the logo afterwards using Canva or image editor
- This is a limitation of AI image generators

### "Variations all look the same"
- Each variation has subtle differences
- Try regenerating with different style settings
- Variations work best with "Photography" or "Lifestyle" styles
