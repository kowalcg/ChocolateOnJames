## Customer Survey Templates – Agent Brief

- **Aim:** create plug-and-play surveys for retail customers, online buyers, and corporate clients to capture feedback and preferences.
- **Deliverables:** Google Forms templates (links + export PDF), question bank organized by use case (in-store experience, online fulfillment, gifting satisfaction), and a follow-up email template for sharing the survey.
- **Design considerations:** keep surveys under 3 minutes, mix multiple choice, Likert, and open-ended questions, include opt-in for newsletter/corporate catalog.
- **Analytics:** set up response tagging suggestions and provide a simple dashboard template (Sheets) that auto-updates via Form responses.
- **Handoff:** document instructions for duplicating forms, adjusting logic branching, and embedding on Pavement or emailing via ESP.
