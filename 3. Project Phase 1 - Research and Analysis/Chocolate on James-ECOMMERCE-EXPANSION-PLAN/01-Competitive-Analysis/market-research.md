3. **Location Advantage**: James Street North serves a trade area of 26,080 households with $65,575 average household income, projected 50% population growth, and strong foot traffic driven by cultural events, art crawls, and proximity to West Harbour GO Station. The area's diverse demographics (40% immigrants) and tourism draw create a unique customer base.

4. **Realistic Year 1 Revenue**: A well-executed e-commerce launch for a local artisan chocolate shop can achieve $50,000-$150,000 in Year 1 online revenue (averaging $4,200-$12,500 monthly), with conversion rates of 1.5-2% and average order values of $40-$60. Food e-commerce leads all categories with 6.11% conversion rates when optimized.

5. **Customer Lifetime Value**: Artisan chocolate customers have a CLV of $500-$1,500, with repeat purchase rates of 30-50%, buying 2-4 times annually over a 3-5 year lifespan. This strong retention justifies significant investment in customer experience and digital marketing.
