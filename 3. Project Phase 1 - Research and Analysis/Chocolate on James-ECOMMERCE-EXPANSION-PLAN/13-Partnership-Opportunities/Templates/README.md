## Partnership Pitch Decks – Agent Brief

- **Goal:** build a slide deck template (Google Slides/Canva) that Chocolat on James can customize for collaborations (cafés, hotels, corporate gifting, events).
- **Structure:** cover slide, brand story, product lineup, customization options, fulfillment & logistics, success stories/testimonials, pricing snapshots, next steps/contact. Provide alternative sections for co-branding and fundraising.
- **Design:** stay on-brand (color palette #4c2a25, cream accents, serif + sans-serif pairing). Include iconography, image placeholders, and slide notes with talk tracks.
- **Deliverables:** master deck with 15–18 slides, condensed 6-slide “quick pitch” version, and export to PDF. Include instructions for swapping imagery and editing data charts.
- **Handoff:** document recommended usage scenarios, send sample narrative script, and prepare a checklist for updating numbers/quotes before each pitch.
