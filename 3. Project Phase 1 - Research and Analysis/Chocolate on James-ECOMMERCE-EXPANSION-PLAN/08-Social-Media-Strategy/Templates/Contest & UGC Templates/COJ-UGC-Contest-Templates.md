## Template 8: Newsletter Feature – "Customer Spotlight"

**Campaign Name:** Customer Spotlight

**Platform:** Email Newsletter

**Frequency:** Monthly

---

**Email Section Example:**

---

**SPOTLIGHT: Sarah's Chocolate Journey**

"I found Chocolat on James completely by accident. I was looking for something special for my mom's birthday, and their display caught my eye. I bought her a single square—just to try it.

She loved it so much that now we're subscribers. Every month, we do a 'tasting date' together. We light a candle, pour a tea, and slowly taste one piece. It's become our tradition.

The chocolate is incredible, but what I love most is that it slowed me down. In a world that's always rushing, Chocolat on James gave me permission to pause." – Sarah M., Hamilton

---

**Format for Newsletter:**

Include a photo of the customer (if they're comfortable), their story (2–3 short paragraphs), and a quote about what Chocolat on James means to them.

---

## Template 9: Social Media Caption Series – "Chocolate Stories"

**Campaign Name:** Chocolate Stories

**Platform:** Instagram Feed

**Posting Schedule:** 2x per week

---

**Post Ideas:**

Each post is a short story + a question to spark conversation.

---

**Example 1:**

"The farmer who grows our Ecuador cacao has been perfecting fermentation for 12 years. Last year, he decided to try a new technique. The result? A batch so good we had to dedicate an entire collection to it.

What's something you've perfected over years of practice? 🤔"

[Image: cacao pods or fermentation process]

---

**Example 2:**

"Real talk: We've made batches of chocolate that didn't make the cut. Not because they weren't *technically* right. But because they didn't feel right.

Quality over volume, every time.

What's something you've let go of to maintain standards? ✨"

[Image: chocolate in progress or team moment]

---

**Example 3:**

"A customer told us today that our chocolate reminds them of their grandmother's kitchen. Not the taste—the *feeling*.

That's the whole point."
