# Content Creator PRO - Version 5.2 Update Summary

## Release Date: November 15, 2025

## Major Feature: TWO-STAGE IMAGE WORKFLOW

### Overview
Version 5.2 introduces a powerful two-stage workflow that allows users to upload an image ONCE and use it in TWO different ways:

1. **Stage 1 (Quick Variations)** - Get 4 instant AI prompt variations based on image analysis
2. **Stage 2 (Full Customization)** - Use that SAME image with all the left panel controls to create fully customized prompts

## What's New

### 1. Visual Upload Banner
When an image is uploaded, a prominent green banner appears above the "Generate" button showing:
- Thumbnail preview of uploaded image
- Message: "Using Uploaded Image - AI will style YOUR chocolate based on options below"
- "Clear Image" button to remove the uploaded image

### 2. Enhanced buildImagePrompt Function
The `buildImagePrompt()` function now:
- **First checks**: Was a quick variation selected? (Original v5.1 behavior)
- **Then checks**: Is there an uploaded image that should be used with user controls? (NEW v5.2 behavior)
- **Falls back**: To generic chocolate prompts if no image

### 3. New buildImagePromptWithUploadedImage Function
This new function creates comprehensive prompts by:
- Starting with the analyzed image description (chocolate arrangement, colors, lighting)
- Adding ALL user-selected options from left panel:
  - Platform (Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest)
  - Season/Month
  - Target Audience
  - Style (Photography, Lifestyle, Minimalist, Artistic)
  - Category (Product Showcase, Promotional, Seasonal, etc.)
  - Special options (Hamilton branding, location, people, etc.)

### 4. Smart Button Text Updates
The "Generate" button dynamically changes:
- **With image uploaded**: "Generate Content Using Uploaded Image"
- **No image**: "Generate Complete Content"

### 5. Output Indicator
Generated content shows a badge when using uploaded image:
- Green badge: "Using Your Image"
- Shows user that the prompt was based on their upload

### 6. Clear Image Functionality
New `clearUploadedImage()` function:
- Confirms with user before clearing
- Removes image data and analysis
- Hides banner
- Resets generate button text
- Cleans up UI state
