**Subject:** Re: Strategic Research - Ready When You Are

---

Hi Dale,

You're absolutely right - focus on what matters today: making consistent products, packaging, staffing, getting through Christmas.

The strategic questions you asked about ("Who buys chocolate?", "Competition?", "Pricing?", "Brand positioning?") - **that research is complete and ready for you.**

**Quick answers to your questions:**
- **Who buys chocolate:** Research shows 4 customer segments in Hamilton ($2-2.7M local market)
- **Hamilton competition:** 8 local competitors analyzed - you're already #1 or #2 with 20-27% market share
- **Pricing:** Your $2.60 truffles are competitive; moving to $3.50-3.99 could add $115K annually
- **Brand positioning:** "Hamilton's Chocolate" - no competitor owns this, it's yours to claim
- **Greatest competitor:** No single dominant player - Walker's has 20%, you have 20-27%

All details are in the completed documents. I'll send you 3 key PDFs this week:

1. **Competitive Analysis Report** (Updated Nov 11)
   - 8 Hamilton competitors analyzed with detailed profiles
   - Market share breakdown and positioning opportunities
   - Answers: "How are competitors doing?" + "Who is our greatest competitor?"

2. **Hamilton Market Research Report**

3. **Brand Positioning Strategy**

   - Differentiation plan and competitive advantages
   - Pricing optimization analysis ($2.60 → $3.50-3.99 = +$115K annually)
   - Answers: "What should we consider for our brand?" + "Pricing expectations?"

**Week 3-4 status:**
- Strategic docs: ✅ Complete (11 documents)
- Dashboard & organization: 🔨 In progress
- Final templates & tools: 🔨 Finishing now
- **Target:** End of November as planned

**Website platform:** Questions documented for future. Pavement launches next week. Topic closed.

You focus on running the shop through Christmas. The strategic materials will be there when you're ready - whether that's January or next summer.

Best,
Greg
