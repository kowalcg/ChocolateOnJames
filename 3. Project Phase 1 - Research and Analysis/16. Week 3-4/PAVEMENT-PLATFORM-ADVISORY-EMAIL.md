Hi Dale,

Thanks for sending over Pavement's responses. I spent some time going through everything and digging into what this means for getting your e-commerce set up and growing. I want to walk you through what I found - not to criticize the decision (you're already moving forward with them), but because I need to understand what we're working with so I can give you realistic advice on what's possible.

Here's what I learned:

## THE SETUP PACKAGE

They're setting up your initial site with 5 pages and 50 products. That part's clear. But here's what I need to know - after they build those initial 5 pages and 50 products, can you add more yourself? Or does every new page and every new product you want to add go through their update queue (which is 50 updates per year with a 2-week wait)?

This matters because growing an e-commerce business means adding content regularly. You need blog posts for SEO, landing pages for campaigns (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, corporate gifting), seasonal product pages, gift guides, educational content about chocolate making - all the stuff that brings in organic traffic and helps people find you on Google.

If you need a 2-week approval process to add a blog post or a new product, that's going to seriously limit how fast you can move. Growing businesses need to be able to respond quickly - add seasonal products, create campaign landing pages, publish content that drives traffic.

So that's question #1 that really matters: Can you add pages and products yourself after the initial setup, or does everything go through their queue?

## THE MARKETING PIECE

Looking at what they said about email and SMS marketing - they mention "1 email per action per order" and "1 SMS per action per order." That sounds like transactional emails to me - order confirmation, shipping notification, that kind of thing.

What's not clear is whether you can actually send marketing campaigns. Like, can you build an email list and send out a newsletter announcing your Valentine's collection? Can you send a promotional email with a discount code? Can you set up an automated welcome series when someone subscribes, or abandoned cart emails when someone leaves products in their cart?

Email marketing is huge for e-commerce - it's usually the highest ROI channel you have. My Phase 1 plan for you was built around growing an email list and using it to drive sales through campaigns and automation. If Pavement only does transactional emails and you can't run actual marketing campaigns, that's a big missing piece.

So question #2: Can you run proper email marketing campaigns, or are you limited to just transactional emails? And if it's limited, can you connect your own email platform (like Klaviyo or Mailchimp) to handle the marketing side?

## THE TASTY LOCAL THING

I looked into Tasty Local since they're mentioning "5 mentions per year" as part of their marketing package. Here's the reality - Tasty Local is brand new. Like, just launched in May 2025 new. It's a startup directory/ordering platform created by the same guy who runs Pavement.

Right now it's Hamilton-only with plans to expand later. I couldn't find any data on how many email subscribers they have, but for a 6-month-old local food directory, we're probably talking maybe 1,000-2,000 people on their email list at most.

So when they say "5 mentions per year via Tasty Local marketing email," what that really means is you'll get mentioned 5 times in a small startup's newsletter that goes to maybe a couple thousand people. That could be a one-line mention in a roundup email.

That's not marketing - that's minimal promotional support. It's nice, but it's not going to drive meaningful traffic or sales. Don't count on this as part of your growth strategy.

## WHAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

Look, Pavement is building your site for November 17th - that's happening. But I need to understand what you can actually do with it so I can help you plan realistically.

The big questions are:

1. **Can you add content yourself?** After they set up the initial 5 pages, can you create new pages (blogs, landing pages, seasonal pages) yourself, or does every new page require going through their 2-week queue?

2. **Can you add products yourself?** After the initial 50 products are set up, can you add more products yourself, or does each new product count as one of your 50 annual updates?

3. **Can you run email marketing?** Can you send promotional campaigns, newsletters, and automated emails? Or are you limited to just transactional emails?

4. **Can you connect external tools?** If their email marketing is limited, can you connect Klaviyo or Mailchimp? Can you install Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and other tracking tools you'll need?

5. **What do you control directly?** Can you change prices, mark things sold out, update product descriptions yourself in real-time? Or does everything go through their system?

These aren't "gotcha" questions - I genuinely need to know the answers to plan how to help you grow. Because here's the thing: my Phase 1 strategy was built around you being able to add content regularly, run email campaigns, and iterate quickly based on what's working.

If you can do those things with Pavement (either directly or by connecting external tools), we're fine - we just need to understand the workflow. If you can't, then we need to adjust the strategy because some of the growth tactics I was planning won't be possible.

## WHERE THIS LEAVES US

The platform you've chosen has some structure to it - that's clear now. It's not as flexible as something like Shopify where you control everything, but that doesn't necessarily mean it won't work. It just means we need to understand the constraints and plan within them.

Can you get on a call with someone at Pavement who can answer these specific questions? Not a sales pitch - just a technical walkthrough of what you'll actually be able to do day-to-day. I'm happy to jump on that call with you if it helps, or I can write up the questions for you to ask.

Once I know what's actually possible, I can give you a realistic picture of how to grow within their system and what the revenue projections should look like.

The November 17th launch is still on track - this is just about making sure we're all working with accurate information about what comes after launch.

Let me know what makes sense.
