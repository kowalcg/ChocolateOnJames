```

---

### 3. **Update "Regenerate Feature" Section**
**OLD:**
```
Use the "Regenerate (Same Settings)" button to:
- Create new variations with same settings
- Get fresh captions without re-entering info
- A/B test different caption angles
- Generate multiple content ideas quickly

Perfect for:
- Creating content calendars (10 posts at once)
- Testing different messaging
- Finding the perfect caption
```

**NEW:**
```
Use the "🔄 Regenerate (Same Settings)" button to:
- Get the same 10 captions in a DIFFERENT random order (shuffle feature!)
- Change parameters and regenerate with new settings
- Get fresh variations without re-entering all info
- A/B test different caption combinations
- Generate multiple content ideas quickly

How it Works (v4.2 NEW!):
- First click "Generate": Creates 10 unique captions in order #1-10
- Click "Regenerate": Shuffles the same 10 captions into a random new order
- Each regenerate click: New random shuffle of the captions
- Change any parameter: Regenerate uses your NEW settings immediately

Perfect for:
- Creating content calendars (generate 3-5 times = 30-50 caption options!)
- Finding the perfect caption by seeing different combinations
- Testing different wording without starting over
- Quick variations for A/B testing social posts

Pro Tip: Generate once, then regenerate 3-5 times to get different orderings. Pick your favorite caption from across all variations!
```

### 4. **Update "Pro Tip 2" Section**
**OLD:**
```
Pro Tip 2: Generate Multiple Variations

Use the Regenerate button 3-5 times:
- First generation: Get 10 captions
- Second generation: 10 more (different!)
- Third generation: 10 more (still different!)
- Total: 30 caption options!

Then pick the absolute best one.
```

**NEW:**
```
Pro Tip 2: Generate Multiple Variations (v4.2 Shuffle!)

Use the Regenerate button 3-5 times to see different ordering:
- First generation: Get 10 unique captions (#1-10)
- Click Regenerate: Same 10 captions, shuffled randomly (e.g., #7, #3, #9...)
- Click again: Different shuffle order again!
- Click 3-5 times: See all 10 captions in various combinations

Why shuffle is powerful:
- See captions in different context (what was #10 might be perfect as #1!)
- Different combinations help you spot the best one
- Fresh perspective on same content

Want TRULY different captions? Change a parameter (like product name or category), then regenerate!
```
