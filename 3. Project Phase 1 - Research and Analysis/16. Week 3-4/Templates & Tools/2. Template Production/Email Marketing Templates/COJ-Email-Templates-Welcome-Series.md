## Email 1: Welcome – Make Your First Taste Count

**Subject Line:** Welcome to Chocolat on James—Your First Taste is on Us 🍫

**Preview Text:** We're so glad you're here. Here's 15% off your first order.

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

We're so glad you signed up. We know your inbox is crowded, so we'll keep this brief.

At Chocolat on James, we make chocolate the way it used to be made—with real ingredients, real patience, and real care. No shortcuts. No fillers. Just chocolate that tastes like chocolate.

**Here's what makes us different:**

We work with specialty cacao farmers across Ecuador, Madagascar, and Ghana. Each origin brings something unique. We roast in small batches. We conche by hand (not by machine) to preserve the delicate flavours. We temper with precision. The result? Chocolate that changes your mind about what chocolate can taste like.

**Your Welcome Gift**

Because you're here, we want you to try something. Use code **WELCOME15** at checkout for 15% off your first order. No minimum. Expires in 10 days.

If you've never tried artisanal chocolate, start here:
- **If you love dark chocolate:** Our Ecuador Single-Origin (72%) is a great entry point. Fruity, slightly earthy, smooth.
- **If you prefer something sweeter:** Try our Milk Chocolate Collection. Still crafted with the same care, just a lighter touch.
- **If you're undecided:** Go for the Starter Tasting Box. You'll get 5 pieces that show the full range.

**Our Story (Quick Version)**

We're a small team in Hamilton that's obsessed with chocolate. We started because we got tired of chocolate that tasted like chocolate-flavoured sugar. Now we work with farmers, roasters, and makers who share that obsession. Every piece is made to be remembered.

We'd love to meet you—even if it's just through your first order.

## Email 2: Share the Story – Why We Make What We Make

**Subject Line:** Why we taste chocolate the way we taste chocolate

**Preview Text:** A behind-the-scenes look at how we think about flavour.

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've been thinking about a conversation I had with a customer last week. She said, "I've never tasted chocolate like this before."

It wasn't a compliment about the flavour (though I think it was that too). She meant something bigger: she'd never *experienced* chocolate in that way. Like it was worth noticing. Worth pausing for.

That's exactly what we're trying to do.

**Here's the thing about most chocolate:** 

It's made in massive batches. The cacao gets processed quickly at high heat to save time. It gets blended with dozens of other ingredients to hit a price point. It's designed to sit on a shelf for months without degrading. It's engineered, not crafted.

Nothing wrong with that if you just want sugar and a vague chocolate taste. But that's not chocolate. That's chocolate-flavoured candy.

**This is what we do differently:**

When we source cacao from Ecuador, we know the altitude where it was grown. We know how long it was fermented (6 days—that matters). We know the farmer's name. That information isn't romantic. It's useful. Because it tells us what we're starting with.

Then we roast. And roasting is everything. The same bean roasted for 22 minutes tastes different than the same bean roasted for 25 minutes. We dial in each origin separately. We're not roasting "dark chocolate." We're roasting *this cacao*, from *this place*, at the roast profile that will wake up the flavours that already exist in the bean.

Then we conche. That's where the chocolate is ground for hours—sometimes days—to develop smoothness and let volatile flavours develop just right. Most commercial chocolate is conched for 6–8 hours. We conch for 16–24. It takes longer. It costs more. But you taste the difference.

Finally, tempering. That's the precision work that gives you the snap, the shine, the smooth melt.

Every step is intentional. Every decision is about respect: respect for the farmers who grew the cacao, respect for the process, respect for the person eating it.

**That's why your first piece of Chocolat on James might feel different.** It's because it *is* different.

**Next Step**

If you ordered already—thank you. We hope you loved it. Reply with your thoughts. We read every message.

If you haven't ordered yet, now's a good time. That 15% discount is still active.

## Email 3: First Purchase Follow-Up – Tasting Notes

**Subject Line:** A little guide to get the most out of your chocolate

**Preview Text:** How to taste (and enjoy) what you just ordered.

**Trigger:** Sent 2 days after purchase confirmation

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Your chocolate has landed (or will very soon). Before you open it, we want to give you a quick guide to getting the most out of it.

Chocolate is meant to be tasted, not just eaten. Here's how:

**Step 1: Pause**

Set aside 5 minutes when you're not rushed. Not while you're working. Not while scrolling. Just you and the chocolate.

**Step 2: Look**

Good chocolate is glossy. It should catch the light. The colour should be even—no streaks or discolouration.

**Step 3: Break It**

Listen for the snap. That snap is the tempering working. A clean, crisp snap means it was tempered right.

**Step 4: Smell It**

Close your eyes. Smell the chocolate before you taste it. What do you notice? Fruity? Earthy? Nutty? Your nose is doing half the work here.

**Step 5: Taste It**

Place the piece on your tongue and let it sit for a second. Don't chew yet. Let it melt. Notice how the temperature changes the flavour. Notice the texture. *Then* let it fully dissolve and chew if you want.

**Step 6: Wait**

After you swallow, notice the aftertaste. Chocolate flavours develop after you eat them. That lingering taste is part of the experience.

**That's it.** One piece, tasted fully, is better than 10 pieces rushed.

**What You Ordered:**

[Item 1] – A Ecuador 72% Single-Origin. Fruity notes, smooth finish. Best tasted slowly.

[Item 2] – Our Milk Chocolate Collection. Balanced sweetness, creamy. Great as an introduction to artisanal chocolate.

**Need Any Help?**

Have questions? Reply to this email. Want pairing ideas (chocolate + coffee, chocolate + wine, etc.)? We've got thoughts. Want to know more about the origins or the process? We love talking about this stuff.

**Next Order?**

If you loved it—great. You know where to find us. 15% off expires in [X days] if you want to grab something else.

If something was off, let us know. We stand behind everything we make.

See you soon,

## Email 4: Seasonal / Promotional – Holiday Gifting

**Subject Line:** Chocolate gifts that actually mean something 🎁

**Preview Text:** Give something memorable this holiday season.

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

The holidays are coming (yes, we know it's early, but trust us: good gifts take planning).

If you're still figuring out what to give—your team, your clients, your hard-to-shop-for aunt—we've got an idea.

Give chocolate. But not the kind from a big box store. Give *memorable* chocolate.

**Why Chocolate?**

- It's personal without being presumptuous.
- Everyone wants it. No one has too much of it.
- It says "I put thought into this" without saying it out loud.
- It's the gift that creates a moment. An unwrapping. A first taste. That moment sticks with people.

**Our Holiday Packages**

**The Tasting Box** ($35)  
5 pieces. Full range of our work. Single-origin darks, a milk chocolate, a specialty seasonal piece. Perfect for someone trying artisanal chocolate for the first time.

**The Holiday Collection** ($55)  
8 pieces. Our most popular single-origins plus seasonal flavours (think spiced dark, holiday-inspired blends). Comes in elegant gift packaging.

**The Connoisseur's Box** ($85)  
12 pieces. The full range. Dark, milk, specialty flavours, and a printed guide with tasting notes for each piece. For the chocolate lover.

**Corporate Gifting**  
We work with teams and companies to create custom collections. Your logo, your budget, your message. [Learn more: Corporate Gifting]

**How It Works**

1. Pick a box.
2. Add a gift message (optional, but recommended).
3. We'll package it beautifully.
4. It arrives ready to give.

Orders placed by [date] ship in time for [holiday/deadline].

**[Button: Start Your Holiday Gifting]**

**Not for Gifting? Keep 'Em for Yourself.**

If you're more of a "treat yourself" person—completely valid. Grab a box before they sell out. We only make limited quantities for the holidays.

## Email 5: Re-engagement – Back to Chocolate

**Subject Line:** We miss you. Here's why you should come back.

**Preview Text:** New flavours. New origins. New reasons to taste.

**Trigger:** Sent 60 days after last purchase (or interaction)

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

It's been a while. We wanted to reach out because, well, we've been busy making new things.

**What's New**

Over the past two months, we've added three new single-origins to our line:

- **Peru 68%** – A new cacao we sourced directly from a farmer collective outside Cusco. Bright acidity, notes of citrus and stone fruit. It's our favourite new release.
- **Madagascar 65%** – A reimagined version of one of our classics. We switched roasters to see what would happen. It's smoother, more floral. Completely different experience.
- **Sri Lanka Milk Chocolate** – A new origin for our milk line. Creamy, slightly spiced, unexpected.

We'd love for you to try them.

**Special Offer for Returning Customers**

Because you've been here before, we're giving you 20% off your next order. Use code COMEBACK20. No minimum. Expires in 14 days.

**[Button: Explore New Flavours]**

**Why We're Reaching Out**

Honestly? We've loved every person who's tasted our chocolate, but we're a small team and we don't do big marketing. We rely on word-of-mouth and conversations like this one.

If you loved what you got before, we hope these new additions might spark your interest again.

If something was off with your last order, we'd like to know. And we'd like to make it right.

Either way, we're glad you're still on this list.

See you soon,

[Founder Name]
