## Implementation Notes

**For In-Store Purchases:**
- Print receipts on standard thermal receipt paper (80mm or 3-inch width).
- Include your logo and branding at the top.
- Keep receipts simple and scannable—customers won't keep them long.

**For Online Orders:**
- Send email receipt immediately upon order confirmation.
- Include order number prominently for easy reference.
- Provide tracking info and delivery estimate.

**For Subscriptions/Recurring:**
- Send invoice each billing period automatically.
- Make it easy to manage (link to account page or include contact for support).

**General Best Practices:**
- Always include your contact information.
- Be clear about what happens next (shipping timeline, delivery date, etc.).
- Thank the customer genuinely (not just "thanks for the transaction").
- Include a way for them to reach you with questions.

---

## Customisation

All templates should be:
1. Created in Google Docs with your branding applied.
2. Exported as PDF for a professional look.
3. Either printed directly or sent digitally depending on transaction type.
4. Stored in organized folders for bookkeeping and customer service reference.

---

**Status:** Ready to deploy. Customize with your company details and use as needed.

**Next Phase:** Integrate with your point-of-sale system or eCommerce platform to auto-generate invoices where possible.
