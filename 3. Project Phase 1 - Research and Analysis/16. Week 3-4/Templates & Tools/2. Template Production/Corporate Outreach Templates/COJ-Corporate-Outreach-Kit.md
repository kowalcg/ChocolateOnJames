## Template 1: Cold Email – Corporate Gifting Pitch

**Subject:** Corporate Gifting That Stands Out

---

**Body:**

Hi [Decision Maker Name],

I'm reaching out because I think there might be an opportunity here.

We're Chocolat on James—a small artisanal chocolate maker in Hamilton. Over the past [X years], we've worked with [#] companies to create memorable corporate gifts. Not generic gift baskets. Thoughtfully curated chocolate experiences that actually make clients and employees feel valued.

Here's what typically happens: companies scramble in October/November for "corporate gifts." They end up with something generic. It arrives, it's nice, but it doesn't stand out. Within a week, it's forgotten.

We do things differently.

**What We Offer**

Customized chocolate collections that reflect your brand and values:

- **Tiered Gifting:** Small gifts for a broad audience, premium selections for top clients.
- **Branding:** Your logo, your message, your values baked in (literally—on custom packaging or cards).
- **Flexibility:** Any budget, any quantity, any timeline (within reason).
- **Local:** Everything is made here. That's a story your clients and employees will appreciate.

**Why It Works**

1. **It's memorable.** People don't forget chocolate. They taste it, they enjoy it, they remember *you*.
2. **It's values-aligned.** Artisanal, ethically-sourced chocolate tells clients that your company cares about quality and doing things right.
3. **It scales.** Whether you're gifting to 10 people or 100, the experience is consistent.
4. **It's cost-effective.** You pay less per unit than you'd think for something this thoughtful.

**Next Steps**

I'd love to set up a quick 15-minute call to understand your goals and show you what's possible. We usually have a few concepts and pricing options we can walk through.

Are you available next week? Let me know what works.

P.S. If you're in Hamilton, we're happy to meet in person. The space is small but the chocolate is worth the visit.

## Template 2: Follow-Up Email – Gentle Reminder

**Subject:** Following up on corporate gifting

---

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I sent a note last week about corporate gifting and didn't hear back. No worries—I know things get busy.

I wanted to follow up because I genuinely think this might be useful for your team. If November/December is a thing you do (most companies do), talking now gets you ahead of the rush.

Happy to send over a quick one-pager with options and pricing, or just grab 15 minutes if you want to talk it through.

What works better?

[Your Name]

P.S. If now's not the right time, I get it. But bookmark us for next year. We'll be here.

## Template 3: Partnership Inquiry – Collaboration with Local Businesses

**Subject:** Collaboration idea: Local Partnership

---

**Body:**

Hi [Partner Name],

I've followed your work for a while and genuinely admire what you're building at [their business].

I'm [Your Name] with Chocolat on James. We're a small chocolate maker here in Hamilton, and we're always looking to collaborate with other makers and businesses that share our ethos: quality, authenticity, community.

I have a few ideas:

1. **Cross-promotion:** Feature each other's work to our respective audiences.
2. **Co-branded offerings:** Create something together that combines both our strengths.
3. **Event collaboration:** Host a tasting or experience that brings both our communities together.

I'm not sure if any of this resonates, but I'd love to explore it. Even if there's no formal partnership, I'd enjoy grabbing coffee and learning more about what you're doing.

Are you open to a conversation?

## Outreach Script – Phone Call

**Goal:** Introduce corporate gifting option in a friendly, low-pressure way.

---

**OPENING**

"Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] from Chocolat on James. Do you have 30 seconds?"

[Wait for response.]

"Great. I'm reaching out because we work with companies in Hamilton on corporate gifting, and I thought it might be relevant for you. Have you thought about what you'll do for corporate gifts this year?"

**IF YES, THEY'VE ALREADY DECIDED:**

"Got it. Well, if you ever want to try something different—or if next year comes around—I'd love to show you what we do. It's different from the typical corporate gift, and our clients really respond to it."

[Leave contact info or ask permission to send a one-pager.]

**IF NO, THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED:**

"Perfect timing then. We work with teams to create chocolate gifts that actually stand out. Not generic baskets—thoughtfully curated selections that clients and employees genuinely appreciate. Does that sound like something worth exploring?"

[If interested: "Can we set up 15 minutes next week?" / If not: "No problem. Can I send you a quick one-pager? That way, if something changes, you know where to find us."]

**CLOSING**

"Thanks for your time. If you want to talk more, just give me a call or send me an email. Either way, I appreciate you taking my call."

## Customisation Tips

- Personalise every outreach with a specific reason you reached out.
- Reference their business, recent news, or mutual connections if possible.
- Keep first emails short (under 100 words if you can).
- Always give them an easy out. People respond better to "no pressure" than pushy sales.
- Follow up, but don't harass. 2–3 touchpoints is the sweet spot.

---

## Deployment

1. Copy each template into Google Docs.
2. Customize with your details (name, phone, email, company info).
3. Add your logo and branding.
4. Export as PDF for reference.
5. Use the email versions directly in your email tool (Gmail, Mailchimp, etc.).

---

**Next Phase:** Track which templates and outreach methods work best. Refine based on response rates and conversions.
