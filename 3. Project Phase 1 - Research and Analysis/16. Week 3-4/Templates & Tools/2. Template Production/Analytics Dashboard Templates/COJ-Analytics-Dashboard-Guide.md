## How to Set Up Google Sheets Dashboards

**Step 1: Create a Sheet**
1. Go to Google Sheets
2. Click "+ Create" → Select "Blank Spreadsheet"
3. Name it: "Chocolat on James – [Dashboard Type]"

**Step 2: Set Up Tabs**
1. Rename the first tab to "Dashboard" (summary view)
2. Create additional tabs for raw data if needed (e.g., "Raw Data," "Monthly Data," "Notes")

**Step 3: Add Headers & Structure**
- Use bold headers
- Color-code sections for easy scanning
- Use conditional formatting to highlight targets/goals (red if below target, green if on track)

**Step 4: Link to Data Sources**
- Import data manually from each platform
- OR use tools like Zapier to auto-update (if applicable)

**Step 5: Create Formulas**
- Use SUM(), AVERAGE(), PERCENTAGE() formulas to calculate metrics automatically
- Create charts and graphs to visualize trends

**Step 6: Share & Update**
- Share read-only link with team
- Set a recurring reminder to update weekly/monthly
- Review during team meetings

---

## Sample Formulas for Google Sheets

**Calculate conversion rate:**
`=DIVIDE(Conversions, Visitors)`

**Calculate week-over-week growth:**
`=(ThisWeek - LastWeek) / LastWeek`

**Calculate average order value:**
`=DIVIDE(TotalRevenue, TotalOrders)`

**Calculate month-to-date growth:**
`=(CurrentMonth - LastMonth) / LastMonth`

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple:** Only track metrics you'll actually act on. Too much data = analysis paralysis.
2. **Set targets:** Every metric should have a goal. "Are we winning or losing?"
3. **Update regularly:** Schedule recurring reminders (same day each week/month).
4. **Review with team:** Share insights during meetings. Data is only useful if you discuss it.
5. **Track trends:** Look for patterns over 3–6 months, not just daily/weekly noise.
6. **Act on insights:** If something's down, ask why. If something's up, understand what worked and do more of it.

---

## Dashboard Tools to Consider

**Free Options:**
- Google Sheets (most flexible, free)
- Google Data Studio (visualization + automation)
- Native platform dashboards (Instagram Insights, Google Analytics, Mailchimp)

**Paid Options:**
- Metabase (data visualization)
- Tableau (advanced analytics)
- Supermetrics (connects multiple platforms)

For a small business starting out, **Google Sheets** is the best option. It's free, flexible, and easy to share with team members.

---
