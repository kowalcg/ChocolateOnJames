## Survey Best Practices

**Deployment:**
- Use Google Forms (free) for simplicity or Typeform for better design.
- Keep surveys to 5–10 questions max.
- Mobile-optimize—most responses will be on phones.
- Use skip logic if possible (show different questions based on answers).

**Timing:**
- Post-purchase: Send 3–5 days after delivery.
- Event feedback: Send same day or next day while fresh.
- General feedback: No specific timing; can be evergreen.

**Incentives:**
- Discount codes for completion (e.g., 10% off next order).
- Monthly drawing (enter survey to win a prize).
- No incentive needed if it's super short (1–3 questions).

**Follow-Up:**
- Review responses weekly.
- Look for trends (repeated complaints, preferences, etc.).
- Respond to open-ended feedback where relevant.
- Implement changes based on feedback and communicate them ("You asked for X, here's what we did").

**Privacy:**
- Make email optional unless you need it for follow-up.
- Always include an unsubscribe option for newsletters.
- Store responses securely.

**Status:** Templates ready to deploy. Create in Google Forms or Typeform with your branding.
