# Holiday Chocolate Gift Guide for Hamilton Sweet Tooths

The shop windows along James Street sparkle this time of year—wreaths twinkling, hot cocoa steam curling into the crisp air. Inside Chocolat on James, we’re wrapping boxes as quickly as the ribbon spools will allow. Whether you’re shopping for neighbours, clients, or the friend who calls chocolate a love language, this guide will help you choose the perfect treat (and order before the snowstorm rush).

## Gifts for the Everyday Chocolate Lover

Start with the classics—bars and boxes that make ordinary evenings feel special.

- **Signature Truffle Collection (12-piece).** Layers of hazelnut praline, raspberry ganache, maple caramel, and espresso truffle, hand-finished with gold dust. Slide it into a stocking or bring it as a dinner-party thank-you.  
- **Single-Origin Bar Trio.** Dominican 70%, Ecuadorian 65%, and our limited-release Papua New Guinea 72%. Each bar comes with tasting notes so the chocolate fan in your life can nerd out properly.  
- **Drinking Chocolate Kit.** Our velvety blend plus house-made vanilla marshmallows. Pair with holiday mugs for an instant movie-night gift.
