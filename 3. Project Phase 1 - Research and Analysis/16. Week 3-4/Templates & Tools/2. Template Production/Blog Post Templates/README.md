## Blog Post Templates – Agent Brief

- **Objective:** create SEO-friendly outlines for flagship content pillars (Chocolate education, Seasonal releases, Corporate gifting, Community stories, Behind-the-scenes).
- **Deliverables:** five structured templates with H1/H2/H3 scaffolding, meta title/description guidance, recommended word counts, internal link prompts, CTA placement, and schema suggestions (FAQ, HowTo, Recipe if applicable). For **each template**, draft a polished, ready-to-publish post (700–900 words) in Google Docs that follows the structure and reads like a genuine Chocolat on James article. Include meta data, internal link notes, and final proofreading. Capture the GDoc link in a handoff table.
- **Resources:** pull keyword lists from Week 3 SEO research, align with brand voice guidelines, and include placeholder imagery notes (hero shot, inline photos, infographic blocks).
- **Workflow:** 1) confirm target keyword and search intent, 2) define outline and supporting content modules, 3) design reusable intro/CTA copy, 4) package as Google Docs plus downloadable `.md` or `.docx`.
- **Handoff:** each template should have a quick-start sheet with instructions for writers, plus a checklist covering SEO basics, readability, and publishing steps in Pavement CMS. Provide the ready-to-publish post GDoc link, PDF export, and note any data or quotes used.
