## Branding Notes for All Templates

- **Header:** Include your logo, business name, address, phone, email, website.
- **Fonts:** Use professional sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica, Calibri, Open Sans).
- **Colours:** Incorporate your brand colours subtly (borders, headings).
- **Signature:** Always end with your name, title, and contact info.
- **White space:** Don't overcrowd. Professional documents are easy to scan.

---

## Implementation Steps

1. Create each template in Google Docs with your branding applied.
2. Export as PDF to use as a standard reference.
3. For each new quote/invoice, either:
   a. Make a copy of the template in Google Docs and edit, or
   b. Use a system like HoneyBook, Wave, or Zoho Invoice that pulls from templates.
4. Always include payment terms, timeline, and contact info.
5. Store copies in a organized folder for reference and accounting.

---

## Key Reminders

- **Accuracy:** Double-check all numbers before sending.
- **Branding:** Maintain consistent formatting across all documents.
- **Timeline:** Be realistic about delivery dates and build in buffer time.
- **Payment Terms:** Be clear about deposit/payment structure. Ambiguity creates friction.
- **Follow-Up:** Send friendly reminders before deadlines. Don't assume people saw the invoice.

---

**Template Status:** Ready to use. Customize with your company details and deploy.

**Next Phase:** Track which clients/order types are most profitable. Adjust pricing and terms based on data.
