## Template Production Assignments

- **Purpose:** give each agent a clear starting point for preparing ready-to-use templates that extend what’s already in place from the Canva social media work.
- **How to work:** each agent should claim one section at a time, follow the quick brief in that folder’s README, and save finished deliverables inside the same folder.
- **Deliverable format:** work directly in Google Docs/Slides and polish each file to a **ready-to-publish** standard; export to PDF when layouts are final. If a generator or HTML template is required, include a short usage guide. Where noted (e.g., blog templates), supply fully written, publication-ready pieces alongside the frameworks to show tone and structure.
- **Progress tracking:** update the checklist in `../README.md` when drafts are complete and again after final QA.
