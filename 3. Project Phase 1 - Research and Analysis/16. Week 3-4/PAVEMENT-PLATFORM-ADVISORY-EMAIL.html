Pavement Platform Advisory</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> November 11, 2025 <strong>Subject:</strong>
Understanding Pavement Capabilities for Growth Planning
<strong>From:</strong> Greg Kowalczyk <strong>To:</strong> Dale Edwards,
Chocolate on James</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>Thanks for sending over Pavement’s responses. I spent some time going
through everything and digging into what this means for getting your
e-commerce set up and growing. I want to walk you through what I found -
not to criticize the decision (you’re already moving forward with them),
but because I need to understand what we’re working with so I can give
you realistic advice on what’s possible.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned:</p>
<h2 id="the-setup-package">THE SETUP PACKAGE</h2>
<p>They’re setting up your initial site with 5 pages and 50 products.
That part’s clear. But here’s what I need to know - after they build
those initial 5 pages and 50 products, can you add more yourself? Or
does every new page and every new product you want to add go through
their update queue (which is 50 updates per year with a 2-week
wait)?</p>
<p>This matters because growing an e-commerce business means adding
content regularly. You need blog posts for SEO, landing pages for
campaigns (Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, corporate gifting), seasonal
product pages, gift guides, educational content about chocolate making -
all the stuff that brings in organic traffic and helps people find you
on Google.</p>
<p>If you need a 2-week approval process to add a blog post or a new
product, that’s going to seriously limit how fast you can move. Growing
businesses need to be able to respond quickly - add seasonal products,
create campaign landing pages, publish content that drives traffic.</p>
<p>So that’s question #1 that really matters: Can you add pages and
products yourself after the initial setup, or does everything go through
their queue?</p>
<h2 id="the-marketing-piece">THE MARKETING PIECE</h2>
<p>Looking at what they said about email and SMS marketing - they
mention “1 email per action per order” and “1 SMS per action per order.”
That sounds like transactional emails to me - order confirmation,
shipping notification, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>What’s not clear is whether you can actually send marketing
campaigns. Like, can you build an email list and send out a newsletter
announcing your Valentine’s collection? Can you send a promotional email
with a discount code? Can you set up an automated welcome series when
someone subscribes, or abandoned cart emails when someone leaves
products in their cart?</p>
<p>Email marketing is huge for e-commerce - it’s usually the highest ROI
channel you have. My Phase 1 plan for you was built around growing an
email list and using it to drive sales through campaigns and automation.
If Pavement only does transactional emails and you can’t run actual
marketing campaigns, that’s a big missing piece.</p>
<p>So question #2: Can you run proper email marketing campaigns, or are
you limited to just transactional emails? And if it’s limited, can you
connect your own email platform (like Klaviyo or Mailchimp) to handle
the marketing side?</p>
<h2 id="the-tasty-local-thing">THE TASTY LOCAL THING</h2>
<p>I looked into Tasty Local since they’re mentioning “5 mentions per
year” as part of their marketing package. Here’s the reality - Tasty
Local is brand new. Like, just launched in May 2025 new. It’s a startup
directory/ordering platform created by the same guy who runs
Pavement.</p>
<p>Right now it’s Hamilton-only with plans to expand later. I couldn’t
find any data on how many email subscribers they have, but for a
6-month-old local food directory, we’re probably talking maybe
1,000-2,000 people on their email list at most.</p>
<p>So when they say “5 mentions per year via Tasty Local marketing
email,” what that really means is you’ll get mentioned 5 times in a
small startup’s newsletter that goes to maybe a couple thousand people.
That could be a one-line mention in a roundup email.</p>
<p>That’s not marketing - that’s minimal promotional support. It’s nice,
but it’s not going to drive meaningful traffic or sales. Don’t count on
this as part of your growth strategy.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-need-to-figure-out">WHAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT</h2>
<p>Look, Pavement is building your site for November 17th - that’s
happening. But I need to understand what you can actually do with it so
I can help you plan realistically.</p>
<p>The big questions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Can you add content yourself?</strong> After they set up
the initial 5 pages, can you create new pages (blogs, landing pages,
seasonal pages) yourself, or does every new page require going through
their 2-week queue?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can you add products yourself?</strong> After the initial
50 products are set up, can you add more products yourself, or does each
new product count as one of your 50 annual updates?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can you run email marketing?</strong> Can you send
promotional campaigns, newsletters, and automated emails? Or are you
limited to just transactional emails?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can you connect external tools?</strong> If their email
marketing is limited, can you connect Klaviyo or Mailchimp? Can you
install Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and other tracking tools
you’ll need?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What do you control directly?</strong> Can you change
prices, mark things sold out, update product descriptions yourself in
real-time? Or does everything go through their system?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These aren’t “gotcha” questions - I genuinely need to know the
answers to plan how to help you grow. Because here’s the thing: my Phase
1 strategy was built around you being able to add content regularly, run
email campaigns, and iterate quickly based on what’s working.</p>
<p>If you can do those things with Pavement (either directly or by
connecting external tools), we’re fine - we just need to understand the
workflow. If you can’t, then we need to adjust the strategy because some
of the growth tactics I was planning won’t be possible.</p>
<h2 id="where-this-leaves-us">WHERE THIS LEAVES US</h2>
<p>The platform you’ve chosen has some structure to it - that’s clear
now. It’s not as flexible as something like Shopify where you control
everything, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t work. It just
means we need to understand the constraints and plan within them.</p>
<p>Can you get on a call with someone at Pavement who can answer these
specific questions? Not a sales pitch - just a technical walkthrough of
what you’ll actually be able to do day-to-day. I’m happy to jump on that
call with you if it helps, or I can write up the questions for you to
ask.</p>
<p>Once I know what’s actually possible, I can give you a realistic
picture of how to grow within their system and what the revenue
projections should look like.</p>
<p>The November 17th launch is still on track - this is just about
making sure we’re all working with accurate information about what comes
after launch.</p>
<p>Let me know what makes sense.</p>
<p>Greg</p>
