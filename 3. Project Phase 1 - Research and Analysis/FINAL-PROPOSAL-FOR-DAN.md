## Time-Sensitive Decision: Corporate Gifting

**⏰ URGENT: Decision needed by November 25**

**Why urgent?**
- December is THE month for corporate holiday gifting
- Companies book in early December for year-end gifts
- Miss this window = miss $15-25K revenue opportunity
- Can't make this up later in the year

**If you want Corporate Gifting Blitz ($1,800):**
- Need to start by December 1
- Gives us 3-4 weeks to execute before holidays
- Can still capture significant Q4 corporate revenue

**Other projects can start January 2026**

## Your Questions Answered

**Q: What if I want to do some things myself?**
A: Perfect! That's why project-based exists. Pick the projects you need help with (email, Google Ads, corporate), DIY the rest with hourly consulting as needed.

**Q: What if I'm not sure about ongoing retainer?**
A: Start with just the projects ($6,300). See results. Then decide on retainer later. No commitment required.

**Q: Can I pause or cancel if things change?**
A: Yes! Retainer is month-to-month (30-day notice). Projects are one-time. Full implementation has 6-month commitment but can be adjusted.

**Q: Will you work with the Pavement team?**
A: Absolutely. I'll coordinate directly with them to optimize your platform while I handle marketing implementation.

**Q: What if budget is tight?**
A: Start with just Corporate Gifting ($1,800). It pays for itself in Q4, then use that revenue to fund other projects in Q1.

**Q: What's the minimum I could do?**
A: Hourly consulting (20-hour block = $3,000). Most flexible, least commitment. Or just Corporate Gifting project ($1,800).

**Q: How is this different from Phase 1?**
A: Phase 1 was research and strategy ($4,500). This is actually implementing those strategies to generate revenue. Phase 1 = the plan. This = executing the plan.
