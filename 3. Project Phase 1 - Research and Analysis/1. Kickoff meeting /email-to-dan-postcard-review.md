Hi Dan,

Hope you're settling into the busy season! I wanted to follow up on our kickoff meeting and get you set up with everything you need for your corporate gifting materials.

## ⏰ **TIMELINE:**

Given your urgency ("like tomorrow"), I recommend:
- **Today:** Review and approve content
- **Tomorrow:** Send to Centre 4 Arts
- **This week:** Review mockups and approve for printing
- **Next week:** Have materials in hand for corporate outreach

## 🎁 **BONUS CONTENT:**

I've also included some additional design concepts and variations that you can choose from. This gives you multiple options to ensure you get exactly what you envision for your corporate gifting materials.

## 📧 **FILES ATTACHED:**

All of the files you'll need are either attached to this email, or available for you to download via the link I sent.

## 🚀 **READY FOR CORPORATE OUTREACH:**

Once you have these materials, you'll be perfectly positioned to start your corporate gifting outreach. The postcards include your charitable giving approach (5% donation) and professional presentation that will make a strong impression on potential corporate clients.

## 📞 **SUPPORT:**

I'm here if you have any questions about the content or need clarification on anything. However, from here, you'll be working directly with Centre 4 Arts for the final design and printing.

This should give you everything you need to get your corporate gifting materials ready for the holiday season!
