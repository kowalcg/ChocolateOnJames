## 💬 KEY QUOTES

> "It's somehow surviving despite being run very, very poorly. Not too long ago it had revenue of three quarters of a million dollars." - Dan

> "If I had to think of a better location for a business I wanted to have, I couldn't. This would be it." - Dan

> "Time equals money. Once you're growing the business, your time becomes more expensive." - Greg

---

## 📊 MARKETING DISCUSSION

**Current:** Zero spend, zero strategy  
**Greg's Suggestion:** 5-10% of revenue (~$2-4K/month)  
**Dan's Reaction:** "That sounds like a lot"  
**Reality:** Need to invest time OR money - as business grows, Dan's time becomes more valuable

**Social Media:**
- 14,000 Instagram followers but low engagement
- No video content
- Need UGC (user-generated content)
- Daughter Tory now managing

---

## 🤝 CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT

**Greg's Approach:**
- Initial hours: Typically no charge (relationship building)
- Larger projects: Specific pricing for defined scope
- Can provide full service OR work with Dan's specialists
- Philosophy: Eventually Dan should manage himself (most cost-effective)

**Website Management:**
- GearTOP can manage OR guide Dan to self-manage
- AI-powered photography solutions (cost-effective vs. traditional agencies)
- Nobody knows the business like the owner

---

## ✅ MEETING EFFECTIVENESS

**Relationship Building:** Strong ✅  
**Problem Identification:** Clear ✅  
**Next Steps:** Defined ✅

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

Chocolat on James has:
- ✅ Strong product and location
- ✅ Committed new owner
- ❌ Missing ALL basic business systems
- ❌ 28% revenue decline over 4 years
- 💡 Clear path to $500K+ with proper systems and marketing

**The opportunity is real. The gaps are fixable. Time to build the foundation.**
