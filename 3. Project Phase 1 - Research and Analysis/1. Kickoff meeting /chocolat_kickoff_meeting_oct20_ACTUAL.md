## PART 1: CENTRE 4 ARTS - DESIGN & PRINTING DISCUSSION

### Business Cards & Postcards

**Timeline:** Dan needs materials IMMEDIATELY
- **Dan's Quote:** "Like tomorrow... I've been here 3 weeks and I don't have any material"
- Christmas season approaching - urgent need for marketing materials
- Cannot give anything to potential corporate clients currently

**Business Cards Planned:**
- **Quantity:** Starting with 250 (not 500 - easier to reprint)
- **Design:** Simplify existing card
  - Keep Chocolat on James logo simple
  - Turn sideways orientation (discussed)
  - Consider glossy instead of matte finish
  - More elegant, less "fun" - brown, beige, neutral tones
  - Remove icons (ice cream, coffee, chocolate bar, heart)
- **Information:**
  - Dan Edwards - Owner/Operator
  - Keep all existing contact info (phone, website, social media)
  - Eventually transition to dan@chocolatonjames.com (from Gmail)

**Postcards Planned:**
- **Two separate versions:** (250 of each = 500 total)
  1. **Corporate Gifting** postcard
  2. **General Store/Retail** postcard
- **Reason for separation:** Too much information to combine
- **Size:** Traditional postcard or longer format (TBD)
- **Content:** Greg will provide detailed text/messaging

**Current Card Issues:**
- Wrong phone number printed
- Wrong postal code
- Previous owner (Mary) just crossed out old owner's name and handwrote hers
- Never reprinted despite errors

### Branding & Logo Discussion

**Current Logo:**
- Simple "Chocolat on James" text
- Some versions have chocolate swirl above name
- Dan prefers simplicity of just the name
- Not completely sold on chocolate swirl

**New Tagline Developed:**
- **"Chocolat on James - Hamilton's Chocolate"**
- Strong emphasis on local Hamilton identity
- Differentiator from competitors (no one else claims "Hamilton's Chocolate")
- Could incorporate "Hamilton, Ontario - Established 2015"

**Design Philosophy:**
- Move away from colorful, "fun" aesthetic
- Customer feedback: "Nobody wants that. They want black, beige, brown, more neutral tones. Makes it look more elegant."
- High-end chocolate ($2.60/truffle) needs elegant presentation
- Simplicity over clutter

**Design Process:**
- Centre 4 Arts will create brief
- Richard Riviera (graphic designer, 15 years with Centre 4) will create designs
- Quick turnaround promised
- Direct collaboration possible (saves money vs. middleman)

### AODA Compliance Discussion

**Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act:**
- **For business cards:** Add QR code with text-based document
- **For website:** Must be AODA compliant (Lindsay Green can help)
- **In-store:** Simple signage, QR codes for menus, clear navigation
- **Free certification:** Online self-certification available
- **Courtney's advice:** Don't pay $10,000 consultants - most can be done affordably
- Store already has accessible door opener buttons ✓

**Courtney's Background:**
- Accessibility consultant before Centre 4 Arts
- Emphasizes practical, affordable solutions
- Warns against expensive consultants who just print online checklists

### Phase 2: E-Commerce Implementation (After Phase 1)

**Timeline:** January-March 2026 (after Christmas rush)

**Platform Decision: Shopify Recommended**

**Shopify vs. Square vs. WooCommerce:**
- **Current website:** WordPress + WooCommerce (empty, nothing built)
- **Shopify Benefits:**
  - Most common online platform

  - Maximum apps available
  - Monthly cost: 3-4x LESS than WooCommerce
  - Built-in payment processing (2.5-2.9% commission)

  - Can integrate Square if desired for in-store
- **Square:** Just payment processing, not a full platform
  - Keep Square for in-store POS

- **WooCommerce:** More expensive monthly, less support available

**Shopify Setup Costs:**
- Theme purchase: $300-500 (one-time)
- Monthly fee: Based on plan selected
- Payment processing: 2.9% per transaction (similar to Square)

**What Phase 2 Includes:**

## PART 4: CURRENT BUSINESS CHALLENGES & GAPS

### Operations (Dan's Reality - 3 Weeks In)

**Daily Struggles:**
- Working 12+ hour days
- Learning to make products from scratch
- Staff management
- Ordering/procurement
- Financial systems (QuickBooks, CRA)
- "Lots of things to do"

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. **Get product in store:** Almost out of truffles
2. **Find suppliers:** Trying to source locally/Canadian (currently US suppliers)
3. **Organize back room:** Chaotic storage, equipment placement
4. **Create marketing materials:** Has nothing to give potential customers

**Current Inventory Situation:**
- Almost out of truffles
- Pan chocolates supplier supposed to come (went to Toronto emergency)
- Trying to shift from US suppliers to Canadian
- Large equipment potentially being removed (chin melter rarely used)

### Store Layout & Equipment

**Front of Store:**
- Display cases
- Coffee station (full menu but underutilized)
- Ice cream display
- Checkout counter
- Storage bins (used to be on floor, now in back - improvement)

**Back of Store (Staff Only):**
- Chocolate melting equipment
- **Enrober machine:** Main production equipment
  - Large chocolate melter underneath
  - Conveyor belt with chocolate "curtain"
  - Items go under curtain, get coated, then into cooling tunnel
- Various storage (chaotic, being organized)
- Window workspace (Greg suggests moving production to window for visibility)

**Coffee Program:**
- Full espresso bar
- Menu includes affogato (ice cream + espresso)
- Underutilized revenue stream
- "Should be a bigger part of the business"

### Financial Tracking (Major Gap)

**What Dan Doesn't Know:**
- Cost per product (COGS)
- Profit margins per item
- Percentage breakdown by category (ice cream vs. chocolate vs. coffee)
- Actual monthly expenses breakdown

**What Dan Needs:**
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for everything
- Cost tracking by item
- Sales analysis by category
- "How can you measure if you don't know what each item costs?"

**Greg's Approach:**
- In his e-commerce businesses: Track every item from manufacture to sale
- Know exactly where money goes
- Understand margin per product
- Optimize based on data

---

## PART 5: KEY STRATEGIC DISCUSSIONS

### Corporate Gifting Approach - CHARITABLE DONATIONS INSTEAD OF DISCOUNTS

**Dan's Innovative Idea:**
Instead of volume discounts, donate to charity:

**For-Profit Corporate Clients:**
- Orders over $500: **5% donation to charity** (on their behalf)
- Pick one charity per year as primary
- Large orders: Client can choose specific charity

**Non-Profit Organizations:**
- **10% donation back to them** (they are the charity)

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with Dan's values and philosophy
- Corporate clients don't care about discounts - it's budgeted anyway
- Differentiates from competitors
- Builds community goodwill
- Chocolat on James gets tax receipt

**Greg's Response:**
- "I like it"
- Common practice for businesses to donate 10% of profits
- May get questions about who receives donations
- Important to clarify wording: "We will make a 5% donation on your behalf to [charity]"

### E-Commerce Launch Strategy

**Current Website:**
- WordPress + WooCommerce
- Empty - no products loaded
- Previous owner started but abandoned

**Launch Timing Discussion:**
- **NOT before Christmas** - too risky with stock management and 2-3x demand
- **Target: January/February 2026** - After busy season
- **Possible soft launch:** Limited selection (pan chocolates, truffles) to test systems

**Required Features:**
1. **Product catalog** with photos and descriptions
2. **Local pickup** (start here - simpler)
3. **Delivery** (add soon after - Hamilton focus)
4. **Box builder** for corporate/custom gift baskets
   - Select basket size
   - Choose individual items
   - Real-time pricing
   - Essential for corporate orders

**Target Markets:**
- New condo buildings (15 buildings, 500-600 people each within 2km)
- Young crowds, heavy delivery users
- McMaster University (40,000 students)
  - Designated pickup times/locations
  - E.g., "Thode Library 7-8 PM"

### McMaster Winter Carnival Market (November)

**Event Details:**
- Third week of November (4 days total)
- Heated 6x6 cabins with 3x4 table area
- **Cost:** $250/day ($1,000 for all 4 days)
- Expected: 20,000-30,000 attendees

**Dan's Perspective:**
- Expensive ($1,000 is a lot)
- Mainly for exposure, not profit
- Unsure if worthwhile

**Greg's Analysis:**
- Depends on traffic conversion
- At trade shows, typically $500-600 for weekend
- 20-30K attendees is significant
- $1,000 could buy significant Facebook/Google exposure instead
- "Are those 20,000 people going to attend that market?"
- Need to understand actual foot traffic vs. campus population

### Hamilton Tiger-Cats Partnership (Dan's Dream)

**Vision:**
- Create Ti-Cats branded chocolate products (black & gold)
- In-store section dedicated to Ti-Cats
- Get products into stadium
- Rolling cart at games (like local sausages, popcorn)
- **Dan already has moulds:** Making Ti-Cats chocolate suckers
- Plans to bring to game Friday, find important people

**Market Size:**
- 25,000 people per game
- Hamilton population: 569,000
- "That's 5% of the city at every game"

**Strategy:**
- Build in-store presence first (show demand)
- Approach Ti-Cats with evidence
- Leverage local pride and "Hamilton is Home" theme

## PART 6: TECHNICAL & SYSTEMS DISCUSSION

### AI & Automation (Greg's Expertise)

**Greg's Background:**
- Runs 2 e-commerce brands since 2014 (with daughter)
- Reduced staff from 11 to 5 people using AI automation
- Spends 20-25% of revenue on advertising (e-commerce standard)
- Replaced ~$120,000 in agency costs with AI-powered operations

**AI Tools Greg Uses:**
- **Multiple LLMs for different purposes:**
  - **ChatGPT:** General
  - **Claude:** (mentioned in context of tools)
  - **Perplexity:** Research
  - **Gemini:** Connected to Google, text + image generation
  - **Grok:** Connected to Twitter/X (20 years of social data)
    - Best for understanding what people talk about/problems
    - Social proof research

**AI Applications for Chocolat:**
- **Logo/design concepts:** Generate drafts quickly (10 minutes)
- **Content generation:** Blog posts, social media captions, emails
- **Product descriptions:** AI-generated, human-edited
- **Photography enhancement:** AI makes professional photography more affordable
- **Keyword research:** Find what people are searching for
- **Market analysis:** Understand customer problems and desires

**Greg's Philosophy:**
- AI creates 80%, humans refine 20%
- Traditional agencies charge premium even using AI
- Learn to use AI yourself = massive cost savings
- "It's changing every two months - unbelievable what's possible"

### Email Marketing Technical Setup

**Current Email:** chocolatonjames@gmail.com

**Required Change:** dan@chocolatonjames.com
- More professional
- Required for corporate outreach
- Better email deliverability
- Avoid spam filters
- **Setup:** Through Google (transfer from personal to business account)
- Can create multiple employee emails

**Email Marketing Software:**
- **Greg's Choice:** Klaviyo
  - Connects to Shopify
  - Event-based automation (abandoned cart, etc.)
  - Professional templates
  - Better than Shopify's built-in email
- **Alternatives:** MailChimp, AWeber

**Email Capture Strategy - IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY:**
1. **iPad at checkout counter**
2. **Google Form** (free, easy)
3. **10% discount incentive** for signing up
4. **Every single customer must be asked**
5. **Automated welcome email** sent by time they get home

**Email Campaign Frequency:**
- Don't worry about sending too often
- Companies with 100,000+ people send 3-4 emails/week
- Focus on valuable content
- "Unless you have 100,000 people, don't worry about that at all"

### Google Presence & SEO (Quick Win)

**Current State:**
- Google Business Profile exists but needs optimization
- Not appearing in AI search results (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- Minimal online visibility

**Required Actions:**
- Optimize Google Business Profile
- Add high-quality photos
- Update all information
- Keyword optimization
- Make location "Google-friendly" and "SEO-friendly"
- **LLM optimization:** Be findable by AI assistants

**Test:**
- Right now: Search "best chocolate in Hamilton" on ChatGPT
- Chocolat on James doesn't appear
- Goal: Be the top result

### Ranking Timeline Expectations

**Greg's Warning:**
"Don't expect that everything is going to happen right away. Ranking we need probably three months for the engines to find you."

**Why Foundation is Critical Now:**
- Takes 3+ months to rank on Google
- Christmas too busy to implement
- January-March perfect for setup
- Results visible by spring/summer

---

## PART 7: STORE TOUR OBSERVATIONS & IDEAS

### Product Observations

**Chocolate Charcuterie Boards:**
- Dan showed one being made
- For parties and corporate
- Locally sourced
- **Issue:** No information about artist/maker
- **Solution:** Add logo, story, card from artist
- Tells the story behind the product

**Coffee Program Underutilized:**
- Full espresso menu
- Affogato available (ice cream + espresso)
- On menu but not promoted
- **Opportunity:** Create viral videos of coffee making
- "Fancy stuff" performs well on Instagram/TikTok

**Ice Cream:**
- House-made
- Significant revenue driver (especially weekends)
- Seasonal but should promote year-round
- Unique differentiator

### Visual & Production Opportunities

**Greg's Suggestions:**
- **Move production to window:** Let people watch chocolate being made
- **Behind-the-scenes content:** Film production process
- **ASMR videos:** Chocolate pouring, dipping (very popular on social media)
- **Process videos:** Show the enrober machine, cooling tunnel

**Equipment:**
- **Enrober machine:** Main attraction - impressive to film
- **Chin melter:** Rarely used, considering removal
- **Cooling tunnel:** Part of enrober system

**Storage/Organization:**
- Working on decluttering back area
- Closing Sunday to organize
- Bins moved from floor to back (improvement)
- Chaotic but improving

### Potential Classes & Experiences

**Chocolate-Making Classes:**
- On Dan's radar but not immediate priority
- Could charge 5 people for class
- **Especially for kids**
- Additional revenue stream
- Community engagement

**Suggested by Centre 4 Arts:**
- Design hackathons with art students
- Collaborative product development
- Print-making + chocolate (member connections)

## PART 9: SOCIAL MEDIA CURRENT STATE

### Instagram Account: 14,000 Followers

**Greg's Advice:**
- "Don't worry about sending too often"

- Video is non-negotiable
- Show Dan making chocolate
- Customer interactions
- Product showcase
- Instagram Stories daily

### Platform Strategy

**Primary:** Instagram
- Local Hamilton audience
- Visual platform (perfect for chocolate)
- 14K followers ready to re-engage

**Secondary:** TikTok potential
- Video-first platform
- "Satisfying" content performs well (chocolate pouring, coating)
- Viral potential
