## MEETING OVERVIEW

This was the official project kickoff following Dan's first two weeks of ownership. The meeting focused on understanding current operations, immediate needs, and establishing project priorities.

---

## KEY DISCUSSION TOPICS

### 1. CURRENT BUSINESS STATUS (Dan's First 2 Weeks)

**Dan's Experience So Far:**
- "It's been wild... a lot of stuff going on"
- Working 12-hour days learning everything simultaneously
- Learning production, store management, ordering, staff relations
- Setting up CRA accounts, QuickBooks, payroll
- Still in learning phase: "I'm just learning how to make the products"

**Immediate Challenges Identified:**
- Increasing foot traffic
- Establishing online presence
- Improving website for corporate orders
- Revenue has declined (needs addressing)

---

### 2. SALES & REVENUE ANALYSIS

**Weekly Sales Pattern (First Week):**
- **Weekdays (Mon-Wed):** $600-700/day (mostly walk-in)
- **Weekends:** 
  - Friday & Saturday: ~$1,500 each
  - Sunday: ~$1,000
- **Revenue Composition:** Ice cream, chocolate, coffee
- **Current Challenge:** Minimal phone/corporate orders

**Historical Revenue Decline:**
- **2021 Peak:** $751,222
- **2024:** ~$450-500K
- **2025:** Dropped to ~$350K
- **Total Decline:** -$214K (-28.5% over 4 years)

**Dan's Analysis of Decline:**
- Previous owner did ZERO marketing
- Lost customers with no new customer acquisition
- No retention strategy
- Economy and chocolate price increases compounded the issue
- "She's been trying to run this place by herself and hasn't been doing any marketing at all"

**Seasonality:**
- December: 2-3x higher than normal months
- Extreme variance creates cash flow challenges

---

### 3. OPERATIONAL GAPS DISCOVERED

**Data & Tracking Issues:**
- ❌ **No customer database** - Zero email list, no corporate customer records
- ❌ **No inventory tracking** - Visual management only
- ❌ **No COGS per product** - Only yearly/monthly totals for accounting
- ❌ **Uncertain margins** - Previous owner reported inconsistent data (61% COGS in past, claimed 40% for current year despite rising chocolate costs)
- ❌ **No corporate customer list** - No way to reach previous corporate clients
- **POS System:** Using Square (some data exists but not utilized)

**Dan's Quote:** "I asked her if she had a list of corporate customers - all these people who order mass amounts for December. No idea. No list. Can't email anyone. Can't call anyone. Just hope they call back."

---

### 4. BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS & STRUCTURE

**Sharon's Role:**
- Personal connection to Dan
- Helps with design and register duties
- NOT heavily involved in business decisions

**Business Partner (Dale):**
- Financial partner (owns equity)
- Behind-the-scenes role
- Dan runs day-to-day operations and makes decisions
- Interested in potentially managing online operations
- Doctor, mostly retired, ~10 years older than Dan

**Debt Structure:**
- Business acquisition debt owed to Dale (business partner)
- Interest-only payments for first 5 years
- Manageable debt structure

---

### 5. MARKETING & SOCIAL MEDIA ASSETS

**Instagram Account:**
- **14,000 followers** (impressive but dormant)
- Limited engagement (few likes/comments)
- Reason: No video content or consistent posting
- Followers believed to be mostly local (11-year-old shop in Hamilton)

**Current Marketing:**
- Zero marketing spend historically
- No marketing plan in place
- Dan's daughter (Tory) managing social media (started 5 days ago)

**Greg's Recommendation:**
- Suggested 5-10% of revenue for marketing budget
- Dan's reaction: "That sounds like a lot" (given zero previous spend)
- Emphasis on User Generated Content (UGC) and video

---

### 6. CUSTOMER DEMOGRAPHICS & AVATARS

**Current Customer Profile (Dan's Initial Observations):**
- Middle-aged to older individuals
- Average to above-average income
- Drawn to high-end nature of products
- Not buying everyday chocolate (Coffee Crisp), buying $11 artisan bars

**Customer Avatar Development Needed:**
- Greg emphasized importance of creating detailed customer avatars
- Multiple avatars likely needed for different segments
- Will help with targeted marketing and messaging
- Process: Name them, characterize them, understand their behavior

**Quote from Customer:** 
"All these colors are sort of happy friendly, but nobody wants that. They want black, beige, brown, more neutral tones. Makes it look more elegant. When you're buying a truffle that costs $2.60 a piece, you want it to be elegant and classy and high-end chocolate, not necessarily fun."

---

### 7. PRODUCTION & SOURCING

**Production Constraints:**
- **Current capacity:** Cannot fulfill $20K corporate order immediately
- **Main constraint:** Staffing
- Dan still learning production processes
- Some products outsourced/purchased wholesale

**Wholesale vs. In-House Production:**
- **Wholesale products:** ~65-70% of chocolate inventory
- **In-house production:** ~30-35%
- Reasons for wholesale: Complexity, specialized equipment needs, efficiency

**Product Categories:**
- Chocolate-covered items: Oreos, sour keys, pretzels, chips
- Handmade: Caramels, cookies, popcorn, toffee
- Ice cream (house-made)
- Coffee/beverages
- Truffles (multiple flavors)

---

### 8. PACKAGING & PRESENTATION OBSERVATIONS

**Current State:**
- Packaging is "adequate" but not optimal
- Lots of colorful, inexpensive ribbons (inefficient to use)
- Long rolls requiring manual cutting and tying
- Large inventory of supplies (e.g., 9,000 truffle boxes - "probably last many years")

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Move toward more elegant, neutral tones (black, beige, brown)
- More efficient packaging solutions (e.g., twist-ties vs. ribbon tying)
- Better reflect high-end positioning
- Maintain elegance that matches $2.60/truffle pricing

---

### 9. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

**Competitors Dan Mentioned:**
- **Chain stores:** Laura Secord, Purdys, Walker's Chocolate
- **Local Hamilton shops:**
  - Locke Street shop (specialty, 3-4 days/week operation)
  - Ottawa Street North shop (TikTok famous, giant thick chocolate bars)
  - Other smaller specialty shops

**Dan's Differentiation:**
- Focus on chocolate-covered items (not just traditional chocolates)
- Purchase items and cover them OR make in-house then cover
- Unique product mix sets them apart

**Greg's Note:** Important to analyze what competitors are doing online and how they drive traffic

---

### 10. CORPORATE GIFTING OPPORTUNITIES

**Current State:**
- Ad-hoc corporate orders only
- No systematic program
- No corporate customer database
- Likely repeat customers but no tracking

**Dan's Target Markets:**
- **Real estate agents:** Open house treats, closing gifts
- **Pharmacies:** Holiday gift baskets to doctor's offices
- **McMaster University:** Dan has connections
- **General Hamilton corporations:** Downtown offices

**Pricing Tiers Needed:**
- Gift baskets at various price points
- Volume discount structure
- Professional catalog/materials

---

### 11. PARTNERSHIP & COMMUNITY VISION

**Hamilton Tiger-Cats Partnership (Dan's Dream):**
- Create Ti-Cats branded chocolate products
- Potential stadium cart/presence
- In-store section dedicated to Ti-Cats (black & gold theme)
- Leverage local pride: "25,000 people at a game in a city of half a million - that's 5%"

**Community Integration Strategy:**
- Build "Chocolat on James" as "Hamilton's Chocolate"
- Emphasize James Street North location and vibe
- Collaborate with neighboring businesses
- "Hamilton is Home" theme
- T-shirt partnership with True True Hamiltonian (Max Francis)
- Cross-promotion with local businesses (e.g., Burnt Tongue for soup)

**Dan's Location Philosophy:**
"When I want to build the brand of the store... I want it to be 'Chocolat on James - Hamilton's Chocolate.' That whole sense of the city and community... If I had to think of a better location for a business I wanted to have, I couldn't. This would be it."

---

### 12. E-COMMERCE STRATEGY DISCUSSION

**Dan's Vision for Online Store:**
- Customers view available products online
- Order for in-store pickup initially
- Add delivery capability quickly after
- **Box Builder Feature:** Custom corporate/gift baskets
  - Select specific items
  - Choose basket size
  - See real-time pricing
  - Essential for corporate orders

**Target Markets for Online:**
- **New condo buildings:** 15 buildings, 500-600 people each, within 2km
  - Younger crowds
  - Heavy online ordering/delivery users
- **McMaster University:** 40,000 students
  - Impulsive buyers with some disposable income
  - Designated pickup times/locations on campus (e.g., "Thode Library 7-8 PM")

**Timing Considerations:**
- Concerned about launching before Christmas due to:
  - Stock management challenges
  - 2-3x increased demand
  - Learning curve with new systems
- **Alternative approach:** Launch with limited selection
  - Easily available items: Panned chocolates, truffles
  - Test systems before full rollout
- **Realistic timeline:** New Year launch (January-February)

**Greg's Technical Note:** 
"Pickup and delivery options are just a switch - straightforward technical implementation"

---

### 13. PRICING STRATEGY

**Current Approach:**
- Inherited from previous owner
- No specific rationale or detailed COGS calculation
- Based on "gut feeling" and inventory observation
- Pricing based on "what customers are willing to buy it for"

**Need to Develop:**
- COGS + markup formula for each product
- Competitive price benchmarking
- Margin analysis per product
- Volume discount structure for corporate

---

### 14. FINANCIAL SYSTEMS & TRACKING

**Current State:**
- Limited financial visibility
- Monthly/yearly COGS totals only (no per-product breakdown)
- Expenses not clearly categorized
- Cash flow uncertain

**Needed Systems:**
- Monthly expense breakdown (staff, COGS, rent, utilities, insurance, POS, marketing)
- Product profitability analysis
- Sales tracking by category
- Inventory management system
- Customer database

**Dan's Commitment:** 
Will send CRA documents showing net income over the years to Greg
