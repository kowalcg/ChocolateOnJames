## Migration Strategy Recommendation

### **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Copy Now, Adapt Later**

**Why this approach:**
- **Immediate Access**: Content available when working on each deliverable
- **Version Control**: Preserve original proposal content while creating Phase 1 versions
- **Parallel Work**: Can work on multiple deliverables simultaneously
- **Reference Material**: Original content remains available for cross-reference
- **Efficiency**: No need to hunt for files when starting each section

**Alternative (Copy as Needed):**
- **Pros**: Only copy what you need, when you need it
- **Cons**: Time spent searching for files, risk of missing content, delays when starting work
